        <h1>ScubaFlex</h1>
        <P>
            A seven week group for scuba divers to learn stuff that can help us stay fit-to-dive in lots of different ways through improving psychological flexibility. Whether you want skills to help you get off the sofa and go for a run, or strategies for dealing
            with the intrusive "what if ...." thoughts, learning psychological flexibility skills will help you.
        </p>
        <p> It's a dry group and your participation is separate from your own diving activities. There is no dive training and no in-water practice at all, and it's suitable for all levels and qualifications.

        <h1>Discover Scuba Diving</h1>
        <P>
            If you love to snorkel and swim, but are curious about scuba diving, then the Discover Scuba Dive is not to be missed! There is nothing more exciting than your first few breaths underwater! No prior experience or training is required to experience the
            underwater beauty of St Croix. A certified diver can even join a discover diver if they would like to dive together!
        </P>
        <p>
            This half-day adventure begins at our dive shop at either 9:00 AM or 1:30 PM where you meet our Diving Instructor, go over the basics of diving, watch a short educational video, and then off to the waters to practice a few basic scuba skills! This is
            all completed in the shallow waters of the Frederiksted Pier just steps from our dive shop.

        <h1>Open Water Certification</h1>
        <P>
            Are you ready to become a certified scuba diver? Then there is no better place to start than right here in St. Croix with Nep2une Scuba Diving. PADI’s Open Water Diver course teaches you the skills necessary to become a safe and confident diver. After
            booking your certification with us, you will receive a link to enroll in your PADI online course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once completed, you’ll need 2-3 days with a Nep2une Scuba Diving Instructor for your in-water training. This educational section consists of 5 confined water dives completed in the shallow, swimming-pool-like conditions at the Frederiksted Pier as well
            as 4 open water dives. The first 2 open water dives are completed at the Pier and the final 2 dives are completed at a reef from our boat so you can experience a full range of diving scenarios.
